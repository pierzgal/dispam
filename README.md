# dispam: Disproportionality of Apportionment Methods

Election results simulator (built as an R package) that uses uniform, exponential or log-normal probability distributions to generate a pseudorandom sample of votes for political parties and then:
* uses a variaty of apportionment methods to disttribute seats among parties;
* employs the most popular disproportionality measures ('seat biases', Gallagher Index, etc.) to examine deviations from the so-called 'ideal' numbers of seats (deviations from the proportionality in elections);
* visualizes relationships between, on the one hand, levels of disproportionality and, on the other hand, the number of parties or the district magnitude.

## Recent/release notes

The package is still under development (ver. 0.1.0) and may contain bugs.
