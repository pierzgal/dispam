# disprr: Examine _Disproportionality of Apportionment Methods_

Election results simulator (built as an R package) that uses uniform, exponential or log-normal probability distributions to generate pseudorandom samples of votes casted for political parties. The package contains functions that eneble a user to e.g.:
* employ a variaty of apportionment methods to distribute seats among parties;
* use the most popular disproportionality measures ('seat biases', Gallagher Index, etc.) to examine deviations from the so-called 'ideal' numbers of seats (deviations from the proportionality in elections);
* visualize relationships between, on the one hand, levels of disproportionality and, on the other hand, the number of parties or the district magnitude.

## Recent/release notes

The package is still under development (ver. 0.0.3 - pre-alpha) and may contain bugs. Currently, it is just a set of functions. The package also lacks a complete documentation.
